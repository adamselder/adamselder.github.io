# I like keeping the chapters standalone, e.g. you 
# can knit them independently. Thus I abandoned having
# the parameters be a "before chapter script"
# before_chapter_script: ["input/setup_code/parameters.R"]

# This should work, but it stopped working.
# Then it started working again, but it confuses the order
# of rmd_files ?
# Thus rmd_files are specified with the subdirectory folder prefix
